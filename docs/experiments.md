## E0. Environment setup (2026-11-12)
- Hypothesis: the reference app builds and tests pass on a fresh Windows machine.
- What I did: installed .NET 10 SDK, started Docker, built `eShop.Web.slnf`, ran all tests.
- Result: first build failed — Aspire CLI bundle download hit the 120 s timeout; installed it manually (`dnx aspire.cli setup`), after that build OK, 125/125 tests green.
- Conclusion: setup has a hidden network dependency; worth documenting for agents in CLAUDE.md.
